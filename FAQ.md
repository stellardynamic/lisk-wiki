## <a name="wDPoS"></a>What is DPoS?
Lisk uses the DPoS (Delegates Proof of Stake) algorithm originally implemented in BitShares. What differentiates it from regular PoS (Proof of Stake) is that only the top 101 delegates are actively forging and securing the network. Voting weight is what determines who is active. DPoS naturally rewards it's top contributors and helps expose or correct bad actors and weak links.

## <a name="LiskCrypti"></a>How is Lisk different from Crypti?
Lisk is a fork of Crypti, so it started out just as Crypti.  Since then though, the code is completely different.  Some of the notable differences are:

* The database has been changed from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
* Completely open source and the whole development procedure is happening in public on GitHub.
* BIP39 enforced for all passphrases
* Lots of optimizations to peer code
* Development is continuing and active, while Crypti seems to have stopped.

## <a name="mainTest"></a>What is this mainnet and testnet?
The mainnet is the actual network that Lisk resides on.  All the coins, blocks, and transactions there are real.  The testnet is a Lisk network where the coins have no value.  This network is used for testing by anyone and is a free area to explore Lisk.
